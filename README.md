# INTRODUCTION

Our topic is chatbot implementation using Google Colab. Chatbots are used in WhatsApp messenger, Skype, and Facebook Messenger. Chatbots save time and effort by automating customer support. Chatbots are also used in tasks like collecting user information, organizing meetings, etc. In this project, we used tflearn library, a wrapper above tensorflow. There are three reasons for use of the tflearn library:
With tflearn, Python arrays can be used directly.
Tflearn API is closer to TensorFlow code as compared to Keras.
Tflearn provides better performance than Keras.

Chatbots are helpful these days. Together with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning chatbots can interact with humans like how humans interact with each other. The implementation of chatbots is helpful in many cases from customer support to personal assistants. So building your chatbot for your personal uses or business makes sense. In this article, we are going to build a simple but efficient AI Chatbot using Python, NLTK, TensorFlow, and Neural networks. This chatbot is highly customizable and can make changes as you want.

It is a tool that is used for communication between humans and robots via online messenger and they have CUI (Conversational User Interface ), which is used to enable humans to interact with machines in different languages, which is understandable by Chatbot. Those can be mostly found on platforms like Facebook, Whatsapp, Skype, Instagram, Hike, website, etc.
